Global warming is an urgent issue that needs to be addressed now. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global temperatures have risen by 1.1 degrees Celsius since the late 19th century. This has had a significant impact on the Earth’s climate system, leading to extreme weather events and rising sea levels.

The main cause of global warming is emissions from human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agricultural practices. These emissions trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to a rise in global temperatures. This is known as the greenhouse effect.

The effects of global warming are far-reaching and will continue to worsen if we do not act now. Global temperatures will rise, leading to more frequent and intense heatwaves and droughts. Sea levels will continue to rise, leading to coastal flooding. This will result in the displacement of thousands of people, with the poorest communities being the most affected.

It is essential that we act now to tackle global warming. This requires a global effort, with individuals, businesses, and governments all playing a role. The use of renewable energy sources should be encouraged, and emissions from burning fossil fuels should be reduced. Governments should also invest in renewable energy sources and introduce policies to
